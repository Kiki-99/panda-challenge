Panda Homework
My top 3 Observations for this homework are the following:
#1)  Males made up an overwhelming majority of total players within the data set, and made purchcases 5 times more than their female counterparts  
#2)  The top spender within the dataset spent on average less than 4 dollars within the game which is less than the average amount of money spent by the majority of players that participated in the game
#3)  Accourding to the data provided, it was discovered that the most popular item and the most profitable item are the same.
